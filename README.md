# Group.ie

Follow your favourite bands across the globe!

## TODO

This is the list of required functionality that I still need to implement:

* Add a proper description of what group.ie is to the homepage
* User should be able to specify their home airport
* Find an API to hook into search for flights - skyscanner api key request is pending

## Future ideas

This is the list of nice to have functionality:

* Tabs on the events page to explore each region
* D3 map to show events in each region on the events page
