## TODO

This is the list of required functionality that I still need to implement:

* Hook into AirBNB unofficial API to find available accomodation for an event
* User should be able to specify their home airport
* Find an API to hook into search for flights
* Create Kubernetes manifests - Deployment, Service, Ingress - and deploy

## Future ideas

This is the list of nice to have functionality:

* Tabs on the events page to explore each region
* D3 map to show events in each region on the events page
